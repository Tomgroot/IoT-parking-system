## Usage
Using InteliJ you can run /src/main/java/LeshanServerDemo by clicking on the green arrow. Though when you want to access the webserver you need to build it:
1. Install maven (https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and run `mvn install` inside the project folder
2. Then run the server using `java -jar target/leshan-server-demo-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
